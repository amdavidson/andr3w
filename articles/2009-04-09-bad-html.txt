title: Bad HTML

Sorry to any visitors affected by the malformed site that cropped up due to my last post…~

Old habits die hard, and I write too many of my posts in HTML only to have a missing quotation mark 
leave my page poorly rendered. I need to rely on the (fairly) excellent built in wordpress wysiwyg 
editor. At least until I write a proper, custom blog engine for this page…

The affected post has been fixed and you can now go about your business.
