If you cannot install the nokogiri gem on ubuntu (required or recommended) for Mephisto.

You have to install two other libraries first that may or may not already be installed on your 
computer:
	sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev

Simply installing libxml-ruby or libxml1 wonâ€™t satisfy the requirements.
