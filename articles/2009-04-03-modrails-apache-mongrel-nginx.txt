Switch…

That’s all I have to say. Passenger/mod_rails is so much faster and more competent at serving my 
crappy RoR code than my hacked together mongrel/nginx scheme that I had before.

My ram usage spikes much more when visitors hit the site, but never starts swapping. The increased 
ram usage is more than worth it for the HUGELY increased speed that I’m seeing by the dynamic 
mongrel management.

Even better, when the visitors leave (as often happens), the ram usage settles down to the same 
place it did with my nginx and mongrel combo.

Enjoy the increased speed and stability [AMDavidson.com][1] visitors.
