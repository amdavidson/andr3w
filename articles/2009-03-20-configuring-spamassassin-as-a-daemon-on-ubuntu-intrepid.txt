title: Configuring Spamassassin as a Daemon on Ubuntu Intrepid

Here is the process I took to install Spamassassin as a daemon working with Postfix to process 
incoming mail.

I’ll also be trying to reduce the memory footprint while still getting acceptable performance. Mind 
you, this is being implemented on a low volume server, so these settings may not be applicable to a 
production server with lots of users.

First, let’s do some prep work on the command line:
	$ sudo aptitude install spamassassin spamc
	$ sudo groupadd -u 5001 spamd
	$ sudo useradd -u 5001 -g spamd -s /sbin/nologin -d /var/lib/spamassassin spamd
	$ sudo mkdir /var/lib/spamassassin
	$ sudo chown spamd:spamd /var/lib/spamassassin

Now edit `/etc/default/spamassassin` and change the lines below
	ENABLED=1
	SAHOME="/var/lib/spamassassin"
	OPTIONS="--create-prefs --max-children 2 --username spamd -H ${SAHOME}"


Edit `/etc/spamassassin/local.cf`
	ENABLED=1
	rewrite_header Subject **SPAM _SCORE_**
	required_score 5.0
	use_bayes 1
	bayes_auto_learn 1
	use_dcc 0
	use_pyzor 0
	use_razor2 0

Now edit `/etc/postfix/master.cf` and change it to look like this:
	# /etc/postfix/master.cf
	26   inet  n - - - - smtpd
		 -o content_filter=spamassassin
	
	# Add this segment to end of file:
	
	# Spamassassin processing filter
	spamassassin unix - n n - - pipe
		 user=spamd argv=/usr/bin/spamc -e
		 /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f ${sender} ${recipient}

Now reboot some stuff
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/spamassassin restart
	$ sudo postfix reload

Now test by sending email to yourself. If you view the full headers it should now have X-SPAM 
headers in it.

If you send an email with “XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X” 
in the body of the email, it is guaranteed to be flagged as SPAM, and is a great way to test your 
spam filter.
