Well, I spent an hour or two last night uploading a couple of plugins and playing with the CSS on 
the site. It’s amazing what you can do with just [wordpress.org] and a couple of hours.~

The theme is (heavily) based on Oulipo by Mignolo. Maybe someday I’ll do my own custom theme, but 
for now, this’ll do; I’d rather be working on my other sites.
