title: YOURLS URL Forwarding with Unicode Characters
author: Andrew

I have been setting up a [YOURLS](http://yourls.org) server at amd➧.ws just to have a shortened URL 
that a is a bit more unique than [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) or [tr.im](http://tr.im). I had some issues 
with my unicode domain and here's how I fixed it.

I was getting redirects to WEBSITE.WS parking pages in Safari and failures to redirect in Firefox 
3.6 and 4.0 when I tried to visit shortened urls that did not exist yet, like 
http://amd➧.ws/nonsense.

The issue lied in the encoding of my config.php file. If you are seeing problems like this, try 
using a good text editor like BBedit and save the file with "UTF-8 with BOM" encoding 
and see if that is more successful for you, it solved all my issues.
