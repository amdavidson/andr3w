Had a [Tumblr][1] setup for a while at [amdavidson.me][2] but I already have a webserver and didn’t 
like dealing with another host.~

So I searched around a bit and [Sweetcron][3] came up as a viable alternative for an aggregator for 
all my internet activities. It’s a pretty cool little app, very lightweight and seems to be pretty 
extensible, if I get around to it.

Anyways, check it out, it has a good summary of all the useless stuff that I do on the internet, 
all three of the blogs, my twitter account, my delicious bookmarks, and my flickr pictures. One 
stop shopping.
