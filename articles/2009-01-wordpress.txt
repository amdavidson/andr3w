Switched this blog from [Mephisto][1] to [Wordpress][2], ~
not a big migration yet, as there were only three posts to move.

Nothing against Mephisto, but Iâ€™d like to focus my efforts on my other site, and use Wordpress for 
this because it works well, and has a ton of plugin support to get the functionality that I want.
