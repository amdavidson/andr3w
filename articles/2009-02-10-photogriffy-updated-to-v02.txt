title: photogriffy updated to v0.2

photogriffy.net was upgraged to v0.2, this is a pretty major update. I’ve changed the backend to be 
based entirely on the Flickr [API][1]. I was able to crank it all out with rails and the 
[flickraw][2] gem over the course of a few hours. There are still a lot of features I want to add 
and a bunch of formatting to do, but the site works as it stands. Rails truly is an amazing 
prototyping framework.

This is part of a larger update to the way I post my photos to the web. It’s getting a bit 
scattered with some photos posted to [AMDavidson.com][3], some to [AMDavidson.me][4], some to 
Flickr[5], and even a few to Twitpic with very little planning or organization.

So, I’m now working towards putting everything on Flickr and then basing my other websites on that 
content so the content is unified between the sites and doesn’t require bouncing around the web to 
places unknown to see it all.
