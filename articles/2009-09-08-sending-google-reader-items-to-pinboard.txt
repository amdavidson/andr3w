title: Sending Google Reader Items to Pinboard

I just started using [Pinboard][1] as an alternative to my previous use of [Delicious][2] and 
[Instapaper][3].

One cool thing that I was able to work out (that I had trouble with using Instapaper) is using the 
new [Send To][4] feature in [Google Reader][5], I can now send links directly to Pinboard as unread 
items or bookmarks.

The [Pinboard blog][5] has basic instructions for sending as bookmarks:

Go to Settings, and then the “Send To” tab. Click the “Create Custom Link” and enter the following:

	Name: Pinboard
	
	Url: http://pinboard.in/add?url=${url}&title=${title}
	
	Icon Url: http://pinboard.in/favicon.ico

But to send it as an unread item just requires changing the URL to:

	http://pinboard.in/add?later=yes&noui=yes&jump=close&url=${url}&title=${title}

If you’re a Pinboard user, enjoy!
