title: Re-introducing Shorten
date: 14/09/2010

After toying a bit with yourls, I went looking for a way to get a URL shortener setup that was a 
bit less complicated and could be deployed on [Heroku][heroku] (a service that I have recently 
become totally enamored with). This is what I ended up with.

After a few Google searches I came across [this][orig] posting by [Andrew Pilsch][creator]. In the 
article he bluntly explains how to set up your own URL shortener and provides code for a Sinatra 
based URL shortener.

This seemed perfect, [Sinatra][sinatra] was something that I have also been wanting to tinker with 
and this seemed like a good place to start. 

The codebase provided was a good framework for what I wanted but didn't quite check all the boxes 
so I set out modifying it to be deployable to Heroku and to generate random short URLs (a la bit.ly) 
rather than the sequential ones that it had originally been configured for. 

I posted my fork of the code on [Github][ghrepo] and have a running example at 
[&#x27bc;.ws][example].

Check it out and let me know what you think. If you get it running somewhere else, 
[let me know][mail] I'd love to see it.
