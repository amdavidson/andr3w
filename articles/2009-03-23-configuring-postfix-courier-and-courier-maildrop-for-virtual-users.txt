title: Configuring Postfix, Courier, and Courier-Maildrop for Virtual Users

Here are some highlights for configuring Postfix to use Courier-Maildrop for local delivery.

This allows some advantages over just having postfix deliver, because you can do server-side 
filtering of spam and mailing list messages to de-clutter your inbox.

All these notes are based on configuring the setup on Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) with Debian 
Lennyâ€™s courier-maildrop

The following are snippets from my configuration files, highlighting the changes that I had to 
make, from an already existing mail server. If these look unfamiliar, or you need more assistance 
setting up the basic framework of a Postfix + Courier-IMAP mail server, start here.

/etc/courier/maildroprc:
	EXTENSION="$1"
	RECIPIENT=tolower("$2")
	USER="$3"
	HOST="$4"
	SENDER="$5"
	DEFAULT="/home/vmail/$HOST/$USER/."

/etc/postfix/main.cf:
	virtual_transport = maildrop
	maildrop_destination_recipient_limit = 1

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
	maildrop unix   -       n       n       -       -       pipe
	flags=ODRhu user=vmail argv=/usr/bin/maildrop -w 90 -d ${user}@${nexthop} ${extension} ${recipient} ${user} ${nexthop}

So if you have a working mail server: make these changes, sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart, and 
then get to work writing your .mailfilters!
