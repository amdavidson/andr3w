title: Configuring PostgreSQL for Ruby on OSX
date: 13/09/2010

I found it to be a bit of a bear to get PostgreSQL installed on my OS 10.6 Snow Leopard system. So 
as I was going along I took notes. Here's how I managed to get it up and running.

~

Despite the ease of pushing to [Heroku][h] for my projects, I like to have a local development 
environment. I have never used PostgreSQL before, and want to make sure that there are no issues 
with bringing it up for a new project I am starting. I first checked what version of PostgreSQL 
Heroku was [running][faq] and endeavored to get that running on my local installation.

First, [install MacPorts][mp_install] on your machine.

Then install PostgreSQL with the following command: 
	$ sudo port install postgresql83 postgresql83-server

Configure a default database with the following commands (these will also be listed at the end of 
the MacPorts PostgreSQL installation): 
	$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/local/var/db/postgresql83/defaultdb
	$ sudo chown postgres:postgres /opt/local/var/db/postgresql83/defaultdb
	$ sudo su postgres -c '/opt/local/lib/postgresql83/bin/initdb -D /opt/local/var/db/postgresql83/defaultdb'
	
It seems that some users, including myself, have issues with the last command. If you get the error: 
	shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Permission denied
	could not identify current directory: Permission denied
	could not identify current directory: Permission denied
	could not identify current directory: Permission denied
	The program "postgres" is needed by initdb but was not found in the
	same directory as "initdb".
	Check your installation.
	
Try running this command (from [here][dscl1] and [here][dscl2]): 
	$ sudo dscl . -create /Users/postgres UserShell /usr/bin/false
	$ sudo dscl . -create /Users/postgres NFSHomeDirectory /opt/local/var/db/postgresql83

After the dust has settled and you have PostgreSQL running, you'll likely want to get the gem 
installed for Ruby to get integrated. 

Make sure that <code>/opt/local/lib/postgresql83/bin</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code>. Then 
installing <code>do_postgres</code> is as easy as running: 
	$ gem install do_postgres 

Hope that works for someone.
