title: Minimalism Revisited

Well, this site just got more tweaking today to make the theme feel a bit more “andr3w”. I’m pretty 
comfortable with it now, it will certainly still change, but I don’t think it will be all that 
much.

The theme that I based my theme on is called [Minimalism][1] and it was done by 
[Christian Geneahr][2]. In turn it was based on the classic [Kubrick][3], a theme so widely used 
and appreciated, I would call it the “Pappy” of all Wordpress themes.

With Kubrick’s fine lineage, Christian was able to make quite a nice minimalist theme. It just 
needed a couple more refinements for me to feel totally comfortable with it and now that my changes 
are somewhat stable, it’s time for me to do my GPL duty.

So, without further adieu: [Minimalism-Revisited][4].
