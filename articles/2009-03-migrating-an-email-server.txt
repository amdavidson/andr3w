title: Migrating an Email Server

Here are the steps that I went through to migrate my Postfix/Courier server from Slicehost to Mosso.~

1. Check current DNS MX records for applicable domains. I had mine set to all go through a central 
A record (my mail server) so it was easy.
1. Set MX records to expire quickly (I think the minimum is 60 minutes). This can take 24 hours to 
propogate, so do this early, and then you’ll have time to do the rest of the processing.
1. Configure Postfix/Courier/IMAP as desired on new server. There are a lot of howtos on this, and 
some hints on this site, so I won’t go over how to do this here.
1. Test server to ensure that email can go in and out and that any spam filtering or other 
processes are operating well.
1. I use MySQL for managing users and forwardings, so I dumped and locked my existing database, and 
copied that to the new database.
1. Rsync maildirs over from the old server to the new server. This can take a while, depending on 
server speed and bandwidth.
1. Ensure that Postfix and Courier are up and running on the new server.
1. Change central DNS record to point to new server IP address.
1. Stop Postfix and Courier on old server. This could lead to a couple of bounced emails, but in 
all likelihood the sending email servers will retry and find their way to the new server.
1. Watch closely.

There should be very little loss of email, connectivity, or data using this path.

If anyone has any better suggestions, let me know.
