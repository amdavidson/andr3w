title: Intrepid's courier-maildrop and authlib

Ubuntu 8.10’s courier-maildrop is not compiled against courier-authlib and so cannot read from many 
of the supported authentication schemes that authlib can support.

Fortunately, Debian Lenny’s can. So if you’re having trouble you can try and install the package 
from that distribution, YMMV.

To save you the effort of going out and locating it, I’ll attach a version of it here. Use it at 
your own risk, but it’s working for me.

[courier-maildrop_0600-2_amd64][1]
