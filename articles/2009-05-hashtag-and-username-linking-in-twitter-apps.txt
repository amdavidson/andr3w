title: Hashtag and Username Linking in Twitter Apps

Are you trying to add automatic [hashtag][1] and username hot linking in your PHP twitter app?~

I just tried to do this with my [amdavidson.me][2] lifestreaming site. It’s just two nested regular 
expressions. If there’s some problem with nested preg_replace functions, or if any regular 
expression geniuses have better ideas, feel free to comment.

But if not, here’s a little code for you, should make things super easy. It assumes your tweet 
variable is $tweet, replace with whatever you’d need.
	echo preg_replace('/\#([a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,15})?/', 
		"<a href=\"http://hashtags.org/tag/$1\">#$1</a>", 
		preg_replace('/\@([a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,15})?/', 
		"<a href=\"http://twitter.com/$1\">@$1</a>", 
		$tweet));
