title: github? we don’t need no stinking github…

I use git for all my projects… I love the ability to commit changes when I’m on an airplane or 
stuck somewhere without internet access. However, I still like to be able to push my git project 
to a remote server for backup ~ 
and accessibility, and I’m not going to pay for [github][1]. Don’t 
get me wrong, github is fine for public projects and collaborative development, but for my personal 
development stuff, it’s an unnecessary expense.

Well, I always forget how to setup a remote master so that I can push and pull and keep a backup 
on a remote server. Here are my quick notes…. for a detailed explanation see Tim Lucas’s 
[tutorial][2].

On server:
	mkdir /srv/git/whatever
	git init /srv/git/whatever


On local machine: 
	git remote add origin ssh://host/srv/git/whatever
	git push origin master

And you're all set!
