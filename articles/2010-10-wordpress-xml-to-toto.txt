title: Wordpress XML to toto

In my efforts to convert my blog at [amdavidson.com][http://amdavidson.com] I wrote a little script 
to convert the xml file that Wordpress can export into text files that toto understands. 

It's *extremely* hackish and will likely not generate 100% solid data, I had to edit ~10 of my 140 
posts. Do not use this on a production system and check your posts before hand. 

If you're still inclined, here's the gist: 

<script src="http://gist.github.com/613256.js"> </script>

Note that the filenames and directories are hard coded... be sure to update them before running.
