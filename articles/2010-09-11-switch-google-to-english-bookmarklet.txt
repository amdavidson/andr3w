title: Switch Google to English Bookmarklet

For those of you who travel internationally like myself, I am certain that you are frustrated when 
you search Google and find that the results come back in the local, unintelligible language. There 
are preference settings for this, but for me, they never seem to stick. Here's my solution.

Here’s a handy bookmarklet that should bring you back to the good old US English Google for search 
pages. Drag this link to your bookmarks bar and click it whenever you see a Google search page in 
the wrong language.

[Google English][1]

For the curious, here’s the code behind it. It’s a bit simple and probably leads to Google receiving 
two localization strings, but fortunately they seem to only use the last one in the URL.

	javascript:window.location=window.location.toString()+'&amp;hl=en-US';
