If you have recently upgraded rails and your cron jobs for acts_as_xapian are failing with the 
error ``undefined method `cache_template_loading='`` check out this~ rails [commit][1].

You may have a deprecated method and need to remove the following from your
config/environments/production.rb:

`config.action_view.cache_template_loading            = true`
