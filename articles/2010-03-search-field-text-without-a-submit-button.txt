title: Search Field Text Without a Submit Button

If you are trying to implement a search field in your website but do not plan on having a submit 
button (relying on the user to click enter), you’re going to want to put instructions somewhere. 
Here's how I handled it.

In my case, I decided to populate the box it self with the words “Type and press enter to search”.
	<input type="text" name="q" value="Type and press enter to search." id="searchfield" />

Unfortunately, this left the user with the task of manually deleting the text in the box before 
searching. Adding a tiny bit of javascript to your HTML element will automatically remove the text 
when the user clicks on it and if the user doesn’t enter anything it will add the text back when 
the user clicks away.
	<input type="text" name="q" value="Type and press enter to search." id="searchfield" 
	  onfocus="if ( this.value=='Type and press enter to search.' ) { this.value = ''; }"
	  onblur="if ( this.value=='' ) { this.value = 'Type and press enter to search.'; }" />

Hopefully it works for you all, I have only tested it in Firefox and Safari on a Mac.
