title: Courier IMAP SSL Certificate Issues

If you are having issues getting an SSL connection to Courier IMAP. Check your certificate files.

In /etc/courier/imapd-ssl:
	TLS_CERTFILE=/etc/ssl/private/certificate.pem

Courier is expecting a PEM file for TLS_CERTFILE with your certificate and private key. Do not use 
just your certificate.

Also, if you require intermediate certificates to complete the trust chain, you can include them in 
this file.

MAKE SURE that you have proper permissions on this file to the security of your private key.
