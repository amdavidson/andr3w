title: Length Errors in Apache Bench

Are you seeing errors for content length in your [Apache Bench][1] tests of your webserver?

I had a hell of a time wondering what was going wrong with my webserver under load and finally 
found the answer [here][2].

Turns out that Apache Bench takes the first pulled request and compares the length to all 
subsequent requests. Makes sense for a purely static page, but when you have a random image 
cropping up, you’re sure to see at least a couple bits difference in length.

So if you’re serving straight, hand coded HTML, enjoy the feeling of knowing that you’re getting 
the same length content each and every time… but if you’re like the rest of us (and anyone who 
would actually be using Apache Bench) feel free to rage that there’s no [command line switch][3] to 
turn off that silly notification.
