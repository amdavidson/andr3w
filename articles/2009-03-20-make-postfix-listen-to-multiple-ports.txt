title: Make Postfix Listen to Multiple Ports

If you need postfix to listen on multiple ports (like I do) add lines like the following ~
(replace numbers with whatever ports you desire):

In /etc/postfix/master.cf:
	25        inet  n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
	26        inet  n       -       -       -       -       smtpd

Make sure to open the ports in iptables as well.
