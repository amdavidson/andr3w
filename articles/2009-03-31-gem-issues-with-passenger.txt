title: Gem Issues with Passenger

I was <del>ignorantly</del> happily letting my gems be pulled in automatically on my previous 
server using Nginx + Mongrel_Cluster and this seemed to pose no problems.~

BUT! when I switched to a new host, I went with an Apache + Passenger ([mod_rails][1]) setup and my 
servers would start but would just offer “Error 500″.

I checked the logs and it seemed that it wasn’t loading [RedCloth][2] so I added the following to my 
environment.rb file and it all worked fine!

In config/environment.rb:
	require 'rubygems'
	require 'redcloth'
	
	
[1]: http://www.modrails.com/
[2]: http://redcloth.org/
