I always forget this… so this is as much a note for me as anything else.~

Especially because I’m basically just lifting this info from [here][1].

	sudo gem install mysql -- \
	--with-mysql-include=/opt/local/include/mysql5 \
	--with-mysql-lib=/opt/local/lib/mysql5 \
	--with-mysql-config=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin/mysql_config

Despite what the linked website says, it appears that this command works on leopard just fine… 
no need for any changes.
