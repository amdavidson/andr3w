Welcome to andr3w.net. 

~

This site has a very simple purpose, in my free time I code my personal site, but that site is 
becoming more and more of a photoblog and less and less web development content seems relevant 
there (although I have always kept it to a minimum).

andr3w.net will be my second home on the web with information about my current effort with rails, 
(x)html, css, js, and whatever else Iâ€™m tinkering with at the time.

Check back soon for a restyling from the default Mephisto style and more content as free time 
allows.
